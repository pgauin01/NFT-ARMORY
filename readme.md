# ⚔️ GenAI GameFi Armory

> **A Full-Stack Hybrid Application merging Generative AI (Gemini), Blockchain (Solidity), and Gaming.**

## 📖 Overview

This project is a **Play-to-Earn (P2E) RPG** prototype where assets are generated by Artificial Intelligence and secured on the Ethereum Blockchain.

Unlike traditional games where items are pre-designed by developers, this application uses **Google Gemini & LangChain** to "dream up" unique weapons (Names, Lore, Stats, and **SVG Art**) on the fly. These assets are minted as **Dynamic NFTs** that can be used in battle, leveled up, and traded.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🧠 AI-Powered Minting:** Python backend uses LLMs to hallucinate unique weapon concepts and write raw SVG code based on user prompts.
- **🎨 On-Chain Dynamic NFTs:** Weapon graphics are stored as SVG data directly on the blockchain (ERC-721), ensuring they last forever without external IPFS dependencies.
- **💰 Circular Economy:** Custom ERC-20 Token (**$GOLD**) is minted as a reward for gameplay.
- **⚔️ On-Chain Battle Logic:** A `Monster.sol` contract calculates damage based on weapon NFTs and verifies ownership securely.
- **🔨 Upgrade System:** Players can spend earned `$GOLD` to upgrade their NFT's metadata (Level) on-chain, increasing damage output.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Blockchain Layer

- **Solidity:** Smart Contract logic (ERC-721, ERC-20, Interfaces).
- **Hardhat:** Development environment and compilation.
- **Ganache:** Local blockchain simulation.

### AI Backend

- **Python (FastAPI):** High-performance API server.
- **LangChain:** Framework for chaining AI prompts.
- **Google Gemini Pro:** LLM for text and vector graphic generation.

### Frontend

- **React + Vite:** Reactive UI.
- **Ethers.js:** Web3 interaction and wallet connection.
- **MetaMask:** Transaction signing.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

This project requires **3 Terminal Windows** running simultaneously.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- Python 3.9+
- MetaMask Browser Extension
- (Optional) Ganache UI

### 2. Blockchain Setup (Terminal 1)

Deploy the Smart Contracts to your local network.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile Contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy Economy System (Token -> Weapon -> Monster)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-economy.js --network ganache

```

_Copy the `WEAPON`, `MONSTER`, and `TOKEN` addresses outputted here for Step 4._

### 3. AI Backend Setup (Terminal 2)

Launch the Python server that talks to Google Gemini.

```bash
cd backend

# Install Python requirements
pip install fastapi uvicorn langchain langchain-google-genai pydantic

# Set your API Key (Or set it in main.py)
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Start Server
uvicorn main:app --reload

```

### 4. Frontend Setup (Terminal 3)

Launch the React Interface.

```bash
# Go back to root if needed
npm install

# Start React
npm run dev

```

**Configuration:** Open `src/App.jsx` and replace the placeholder addresses with the ones generated in Terminal 1.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Connect Wallet:** Click "Connect" to link MetaMask (Ensure you are on Localhost:8545).
2. **The Forge:** Type a prompt (e.g., _"A cybernetic hammer made of neon glass"_).
3. **Mint:** The AI generates the stats and art. Sign the transaction to mint it as an NFT.
4. **The Arena:** Equip your weapon from the "Armory" and attack the Monster.
5. **Earn:** Killing the monster rewards you with **$GOLD**.
6. **Upgrade:** Use your `$GOLD` balance to upgrade your weapon (Level +1), increasing its damage for future fights.

## 📜 Smart Contract Architecture

- **`AIWeapon.sol` (ERC-721):** Stores the NFT data. Contains `upgradeWeapon()` function which burns tokens to increase level.
- **`GameToken.sol` (ERC-20):** The currency. Only the Monster contract is authorized to mint new tokens.
- **`Monster.sol`:** Game engine. Verifies weapon ownership via `Interface`, calculates damage, and distributes rewards.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Deploy to **Sepolia Testnet**.
- [ ] Add a Marketplace to trade weapons with other players.
- [ ] Implement "Staking" to earn passive interest on Weapons.
