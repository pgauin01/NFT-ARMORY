Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability. Requirements: - `from` cannot be the zero address. - `to` cannot be the zero address. - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`. - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.
